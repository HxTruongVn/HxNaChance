- [x] Preserve Core host versus Workshop window hierarchy
- [x] Port Workshop launcher buttons and open/close/toggle behavior
- [x] Port separate Workshop windows instead of flattening all UI into host tabs
- [x] Port nested side panels for orientation, result and Layout preview
- [ ] Preserve active workspace/window state and session ordering
- [ ] Port context-sensitive menu/shortcut behavior at each display level
- [ ] Port multi-level dialogs and About/Environment/Resource panels
- [ ] Add hierarchy tests for host, Workshop windows and side panels

## Layout parity correction

- [x] Port every Layout preset from `layout_presets.json`
- [x] Support selecting multiple presets at the same time
- [x] Preserve per-preset count and formula editing
- [x] Preserve canvas size, resolution, gap, margins and `valF`
- [x] Preserve CAF mode, stroke, color and width controls
- [x] Preserve source append mode and existing output continuation

- [x] Add Repo Intake manifest view
- [x] Add offscreen Qt smoke test
- [x] Run main regression tests
- [ ] Port remaining main UI actions and dialogs
- [ ] Port adaptive menus and shortcuts with main behavior parity
- [ ] Port orientation preview, side panels and saved-state dialogs
- [ ] Validate full desktop flows on Windows/Linux with PySide6
